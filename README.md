## Image Understanding with Deep Learning and Mathematics (IUDLM)
This is to understand images with deep learning approaches. As IUDLM tells, it involves Image Understanding
(object detection, localization, recognition, segmentation, understanding), Deep Learning (CNN, RNN, RL), and Mathematics (Optimization, Statistics). 
Our goal is to combine deep learning and object detection. For the overview of framework,
we refer to [Object Detection with Deep Learning: A Review -- Zhong-Qiu Zhao](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05511). We will borrow our machine learning algorithms and Cameo architecture.

 ## Day 1
 Reference: [Selective Search for Object Recognition -- J.R.R. Uijlings](http://huppelen.nl/publications/selectiveSearchDraft.pdf)
  
 Problem: Generating possible object locations for use in object recognition
  
 Solution:  Selective Search
 
 ## Day 2
 Reference: [Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation -- Pedro F. Felzenszwalb](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~pff/papers/seg-ijcv.pdf)
 
 Problem: segmenting an image into regions
 
 Solution: Graph-Based Image Segmentation
 
 Reference: [Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation -- Ross Girshick](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2014/papers/Girshick_Rich_Feature_Hierarchies_2014_CVPR_paper.pdf)
 
 Framework: R-CNN: Regions with CNN features
 
 Modules
  1. Region proposals
  2. Feature extraction
  3. Classification
  
Here we are focused on Region proposals. We have built the other modules. Once we can finish the region proposals module, we can build R-CNN, and its variants.

## Day 3
We refer to source code mentioned in Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation. We will write the prototpye using python.

## Day 4
We build a rough prototpye using Python.

## Day 5
We build the prototype using object-oriented programming.

The goal is to sequentially retain learned knowledge and to selectively transfer that knowledge when learning a new task so as to develop more accurate hypotheses or policies.

## Day 6
We went over the Deep learning notes [cmu -- Deep learaning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bhiksha/courses/deeplearning/Spring.2019/www/).
This is to introduce Deep learning with neural network.

[Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation -- Ross Girshick](http://www.rossgirshick.info/) proposes R-CNN -- Regions with CNN features.

## Day 7
Reference, Matching Networks for One Shot Learning -- Oriol Vinyals, consists of learning a class from a single labelled example.
